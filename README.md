Adapted from the superb examples by Kirill Grouchnikov.

Please see https://github.com/kirill-grouchnikov/artemis/blob/woodland/src/main/kotlin/org/pushingpixels/artemis/shaders/ShaderDemo.kt for origional code.

Also his articles on Desktop Shaders https://www.pushing-pixels.org/2021/09/22/skia-shaders-in-compose-desktop.html

I've adaped the code as a composable, with resizing shader, and passing uniforms via shaderBuilder.

The SKSL Shader is the shader from https://shaders.skia.org/?id=de2a4d7d893a7251eb33129ddf9d76ea517901cec960db116a1bbd7832757c1f
